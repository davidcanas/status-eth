A dynamic website status page, showing uptime/downtime statistics. This makes use of the Uptime Robot API for monitoring.

Add your API Key from Uptime Robot on line 4 of 'monitoring.php' and you are good to go:

```
$api_key = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY';
```

This project also uses Chart JS to represent uptime/downtime data!
